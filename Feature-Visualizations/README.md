# VISUALIZING FEATURES

## About the code
- Presently `visualization.py` involves applying PCA and t-SNE on MNIST dataset.
- Later reduced 2-D features of this dataset are visualized by embedding images at each data point using [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).

## How to run
- `python visualization.py`
-  To view our learned embeddings open `visualization.html` which would be created in the same directory.
